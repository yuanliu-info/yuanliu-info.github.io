*Research Experience<br/>
2019 - now NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;I designed an efficient topology discovery protocol for underwater acoustic networks (ETDP). The protocol accomplishes network topology discovery and obtain the whole network topology for each node with a significant reduced energy consumption and certain duration; The dynamic topology discovery protocol of underwater acoustic network based on node hierarchy model was established, which is first protocol considering to realize heterogeneous merging of underwater acoustic network with different sizes and structures by topology discovery.<br/>

2016 - 2019 NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA<br/>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; I proposed a topology discovery protocol for initializing a network deployable autonomous underwater system in which the nodes have no knowledge of the system topology upon deployment. The goal is to establish multi-hop, minimum-power acoustic communication links over a given coverage area. The protocol base on the uniqueness of node IDs, adopt TDMA mechanism to remove the risk of collision of topology discovery packets and then reduce the energy consumption.<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;I have three national invention patents and two international conference paper.<br/>

 &nbsp; &nbsp;Under the situation of limited statistics and time<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;● Study the characteristics of underwater acoustic network and read a lot of paper<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;● Gone with the experimental ship to off-shore installations to collect data<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;● Designed the common procedure of wireless sensor networks simulation based on OPNET<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;● Analyzed the data and modify program to achieve good performance.<br/>
2016 - 2017 THE 12th FIVE-YEAR PRE-RESEARCH PROJECT<br/>
        &nbsp;     Research on network initialization.The initialization method is an important procedure for network protocol. It has two parts, self-localization and time synchronization. I had researched a self-localization algorithm with selected reference nodes only using on e anchor. This algorithm reduces the influence of topology and range error. It has a high accuracy without using a lot of anchors.<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Besides, Unlike earlier range-based 3D localization techniques that required distance estimates from at least four reference nodes to localize any node, LOTUS can approximate locations with two references. This enables LOTUS to work in low density deployment cases and allows more nodes to be localized. <br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;In regard to time synchronization, we solve the time synchronization and localization problems at the same time, which can decrease the time delay of the initialization process and the communication traffic.<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;● Under the situation of limited statistics and time<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;● Learned the existing localization and time synchronization algorithm<br/>
